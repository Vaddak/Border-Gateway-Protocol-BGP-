# Border-Gateway-Protocol-BGP-
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the routing protocol used to exchange routing information between autonomous systems (AS) on the Internet. Unlike interior routing protocols such as OSPF or EIGRP, BGP is used for routing between different organizations and Internet Service Providers (ISPs).
